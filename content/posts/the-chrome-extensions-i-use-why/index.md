I've been using [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) for 10+ years and over the years "collected" a few extensions that I use daily. P.S. I even use the canary version to get the latest features!

I've also written a list of [the extensions that I use on Visual Studio Code](https://blog.rodrigograca.com/the-visual-studio-code-extensions-i-use-full-stack-developer-why/) to help me code faster/better.

[Let me know](https://twitter.com/rodrigograca31) if you got an extension that I should be using!

## [Adblock Plus - free ad blocker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus-free-ad-bloc/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb)

> Block YouTube™ ads, pop-ups & fight malware!

Ad blocking. All said.

I recently switched from [AdBlock — best ad blocker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-%E2%80%94-best-ad-blocker/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom) to [Adblock Plus - free ad blocker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus-free-ad-bloc/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb) because for some reason I was still getting ads! Like I said above I use the canary version of Chrome but this went on for multiple versions without a fix. There were also some changes coming to Chrome which were supposed to break ad blockers because of the big lists they use.

## [BetterTTV](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/betterttv/ajopnjidmegmdimjlfnijceegpefgped)

> BetterTTV enhances Twitch with new features, emotes, and more.

It provides an overall better Twitch experience. I use it to have better chat readability and other small tweaks.

## [Bishop Vulnerability Scanner](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bishop-vulnerability-scan/cbkdeoaaclnbidadjimofnhpbfhjakoe)

> Search websites for git repos, exposed config files, and more as you browse.

A pretty unique extension that warns me if I have (or find) a website with its `.git` exposed, because an attacker can clone it and get extra information.

## [Dark Reader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh)

> Dark mode for every website. Take care of your eyes, use dark theme for night and daily browsing.

This is one of my favorite extensions! It adds Dark mode to every single website by inverting the colors. This saves my eyes a lot from looking at bright and white screens all day.

## [Decentraleyes](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/decentraleyes/ldpochfccmkkmhdbclfhpagapcfdljkj)

> Protects you against tracking through "free", centralized, content delivery.

I don't use this extension for its intended purpose. I use it to slightly speed up page loading. Because this extension caches locally several well-known files like the jQuery library.

I currently have my counter at `4,709`. That means I saved some bandwidth almost 5000 times!

## [EditThisCookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg)

> EditThisCookie is a cookie manager. You can add, delete, edit, search, protect and block cookies!

The quote above says it all.

## [Enhanced GitHub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/enhanced-github/anlikcnbgdeidpacdbdljnabclhahhmd)

> Display repo size, size of each file, download link and option to copy file contents

It makes downloading a single file from GitHub easy! As well as other improvements.

## [Full Page Screenshot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/full-page-screenshot/glgomjpomoahpeekneidkinhcfjnnhmb)

> Take awesome screenshots of entire websites and capture page elements. No sign up. Offline. By Conceptboard

As the name suggests, it takes screenshots of entire pages, it scrolls down and keeps adding to the final image. Unlike a normal screenshot. This can be very useful sometimes.

## [GitHub File Icons](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-file-icons/kkokonbjllgdmblmbichgkkikhlcnekp)

> Display file icons on GitHub

Have you ever noticed how boring the GitHub icons are? It's just a plain white icon. No more! With this extension, you will have beautiful icons matching the file type as you do on your code editor.

## [Grammarly for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen)

> Write your best with Grammarly for Chrome.

Since I'm not a native English speaker, Grammarly is a lifesaver! It fixes my typos and grammatical errors! I also run my blog posts through it! I wish I could afford the paid version but I currently can't.

## [GraphQL developer tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/graphql-developer-tools/hflnkihcpgldmkepajmpooacmmhglpff)

> Devtools panel for GraphQL development

I've not used this extension that much yet but from the name, you can see its an inspector for GraphQL requests/queries.

## [Honey](https://www.joinhoney.com/ref/iq07d3m)

> Automatically find and apply coupon codes when you shop online!

Honey is the number 1 extension to save you money. It supports thousands of sites and it gives ou coupons when checking out.

## [LastPass: Free Password Manager](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lastpass-free-password-ma/hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd)

> LastPass, an award-winning password manager, saves your passwords and gives you secure access from every computer and mobile device.

LastPass is my password manager of choice. It generates long and secure passwords and saves them very securely and finally syncs it to my other devices. This allows me to use unique and safe passwords everywhere without having to remember them.

**Pro tip**: Don't store the most important ones. Keep your top 5 in your head, for example, email, Facebook, Twitter, bank, secondary email, etc.

## [META SEO inspector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/meta-seo-inspector/ibkclpciafdglkjkcibmohobjkcfkaef)

> Useful to inspect the meta data found inside web pages, usually not visible while browsing.

I use this extension to inspect SEO data on my blog to make sure its good. I check that I got all the meta tags, titles aren't too long, and that the page has a description.

## [MonkeyECHO - GearBest Price Tracker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/monkeyecho-gearbest-price/fdmdnnfdofijijgcbhdbnlohaabnmdkb)

> GearBest Price Tracker & Daily Coupons

I'm a big GearBest user/buyer and this extension allows me to see when the prices are lower and save some money. There's also a great website with [all GearBest coupons](https://coupons.31apps.com/)

## [OctoLinker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/octolinker/jlmafbaeoofdegohdhinkhilhclaklkp)

> OctoLinker – Links together, what belongs together.

Its another extension for GitHub. It turns `require` or `import` into links to the files being required/imported.

## [Octotree](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/octotree/bkhaagjahfmjljalopjnoealnfndnagc)

> Browser extension that enhances GitHub code review and exploration.

It provides an easier/faster way to browse GitHub thought a file tree explorer.

## [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)

> Adds React debugging tools to the Chrome Developer Tools. Created from revision fed4ae024 on 7/15/2020.

I think the title says it all. It allows you to see the components, the properties being passed and other React things.

## [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd)

> Redux DevTools for debugging application's state changes.

If you are a ReactJS developer you already know this extension. It allows you to inspect/manipulate the state of your application.

## [Session Buddy](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/session-buddy/edacconmaakjimmfgnblocblbcdcpbko)

> Manage Browser Tabs and Bookmarks with Ease

This one is very specific to me because I run Chrome Unstable and usually have dozens if not hundreds of tabs open and if Chrome happens to crash I will lose them. I use this extension to save my tabs in case Chrome didn't save them when it crashed.

## [Simplify Gmail](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simplify-gmail/pbmlfaiicoikhdbjagjbglnbfcbcojpj)

> Simplifies Gmail interface to the bare minimum

I think this one is self-explanatory. It cleans the Gmail UI and allows you to focus on your unread emails.

## [StayFocusd](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji)

> StayFocusd increases your productivity by limiting the amount of time that you can spend on time-wasting websites.

This one is a recent addition and I'm still experimenting with it but it allows me to block a few sites that I shouldn't be on during the day, like, Facebook, Twitter, games, etc.

## [Stylish - Custom themes for any website](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe)

> Customize any website to your color scheme in 1 click, thousands of user styles with beautiful themes, skins & free backgrounds.

I don't use this extension anymore because of Dark Reader. But I used to use it to have a dark theme on some websites like GitHub.

## [Syntaxtic!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/syntaxtic/cgjalgdhmbpaacnnejmodfinclbdgaci)

> Performs syntax highlighting on files visited in the browser based on their extension

If you are a coder like me you need this extension. Every time you open a `.css` or `.js` or any other code file it will do syntax highlighting on your browser page. that makes it way easier and faster to read code.

## [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)

> The world's most popular userscript manager

I use Tampermonkey daily to run dozens of JavaScript scripts (62) on my browser.
Since I'm a JavaScript developer its easy to automate tasks. From auto-closing tabs after X seconds or clicking things for me, I have scripts for all kinds of things.

## [The Great Suspender](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg)

> Make your computer run smoothly by suspending the tabs you aren't using
>
> A lightweight extension to reduce chrome's memory footprint. Perfect if you have a lot of tabs open at the same time.

Awesome RAM saver! If you don't use a tab for a while it "unloads it" from memory. That's how I can have 100+ tabs open 😅

## [Toggl Track: Productivity & Time Tracker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/toggl-track-productivity/oejgccbfbmkkpaidnkphaiaecficdnfn)

> Puts a timer into any web tool and allows quick real time productivity tracking with all the data stored on your Toggl account

I use the Toggle service (extension + site) to track my billable hours on freelance projects for clients. I use it in conjunction with Trello because it gives me a start/stop button on each card and even each list item which makes it easy to know how long I took to implement a given feature.

## [Twitch Channel Points Auto-Clicker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twitch-channel-points-aut/mdlokilgafgmaeojenoidfpjcacpllap)

> Auto-click those channel point bonuses

If you use Twitch a lot you know what this extension is for 😎

## [WOT Web of Trust, Website Reputation Ratings](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wot-web-of-trust-website/bhmmomiinigofkjcapegjjndpbikblnp)

> Ever wondered how to check if a website is safe? Get the community to do the checks for you.

I've been using WOT for almost 10 years. This extension warns you if a website is dangerous or not even before you click. It will add a green/rea/grey circle after each link letting you know if it's safe to click. Of course, it saves you from getting a virus but if a website is known to be dangerous it will let you know.

## [YouTube Captions Search](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-captions-search/kimbeggjgnmckoikpckibeoaocafcpbg)

> It's like 'ctrl + f' (or 'cmd + f'), but for YouTube

If you are like me and listen to long-form content (Podcasts) and then you want to share it with a friend but you don't remember at which timestamp something was said you can search through the YouTube captions and find it with this extension.

[Let me know](https://twitter.com/rodrigograca31) if you got an extension that I should definitely be using!
